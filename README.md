# DMA Project

This project is based on the Driven Data Competion: [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). It is also for the Data Modelling & Analysis Module (2023) at the University of Nottingham.

We have also produced multiple .ipynb files that sit in the root directory. These are:
  - (1) Data Understanding & Statistical Analysis
  - (2) Data Wrangling & Preprocessing
  - (3) EDA & Modelling

To understand our process, you should view these in order. Any additional notebooks are assumed to be `testers` or `scratchpads` for the main notebooks.

We also have a "Pipeline" .ipynb file that will be used to run our finalised approach in one .ipynb. This notebook provides a main function that takes a test_dataset and model pickle file in order to produce an output compatible with the one provided in DrivenData.
