# DMA Project

This project is based on the Driven Data Competion: [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). It is also for the Data Modelling & Analysis Module (2023) at the University of Nottingham.


For now we are using individual testing files to test our code, contained in the `testing-notebooks` folder.

We will also produce multiple .ipynb files that will sit in the root directory. These will be:
  - (1) Data Understanding & Statistical Analysis
  - (2) Data Wrangling & Preprocessing
  - (3) EDA & Feature Engineering
  - (4) Modelling

To understand our process, you should view these in order.

We will also have a "main" .ipynb file that will be used to run our finalised approach in one .ipynb
