# DMA Project

This project is based on the Driven Data Competion: [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). It is also for the Data Modelling & Analysis Module (2023) at the University of Nottingham.


The final output will be a singular Jupyter Notebook file, however, for now we are using individual testing files to test our code, contained in the `testing-notebooks` folder.

To use the project clone the repo and have a look through the .ipynb files.
